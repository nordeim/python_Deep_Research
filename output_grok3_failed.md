First, I need to deeply analyze the problem: creating an improved deep research tool based on the provided code. The goal is to enhance its web search capabilities, data processing, and report generation while ensuring the final code is robust, efficient, and fully functional. Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Understanding the Existing Code
The current code is a deep research tool that:
1. Takes a user query, LLM choice (OpenAI or Gemini), depth (iterations), number of search queries, and optional manual URLs.
2. Generates search queries using the chosen LLM.
3. Performs Google searches for each query to fetch URLs.
4. Scrapes content from URLs using `crawl4ai`.
5. Summarizes scraped content and generates follow-up questions using the LLM.
6. Iterates the process for the specified depth.
7. Outputs a Markdown report via a Gradio interface.

Key components:
- **Search Query Generation**: Uses LLMs to generate diverse queries.
- **Web Search**: Uses Google search via `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.
- **Content Scraping**: Uses `crawl4ai` with concurrent scraping.
- **Summarization and Follow-Up**: Uses LLMs to summarize content and generate follow-up questions.
- **Interface**: Gradio for user interaction.

### Step 2: Identifying Limitations and Areas for Improvement
To create a better deep research tool, I need to identify weaknesses in the current implementation and propose enhancements. Let's analyze each component:

#### 2.1 Search Query Generation
- **Current State**: Generates queries using LLMs, but the prompt is basic and doesn't ensure query diversity or relevance.
- **Limitations**:
  - No validation of generated queries for quality or uniqueness.
  - No mechanism to refine queries based on previous iterations' results.
  - Limited control over query specificity (broad vs. narrow).
- **Improvements**:
  - Enhance the prompt to ensure diverse, relevant, and specific queries.
  - Add validation to filter out low-quality or redundant queries.
  - Use previous iteration summaries to refine queries dynamically.
  - Allow user-specified query types (e.g., broad, specific, technical).

#### 2.2 Web Search
- **Current State**: Uses Google search with `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to extract URLs.
- **Limitations**:
  - Relies on scraping Google, which is fragile and prone to blocking (e.g., rate limits, CAPTCHAs).
  - Limited to top 5 URLs per query, which may miss relevant sources.
  - No ranking or filtering of URLs for quality/relevance.
  - No support for alternative search engines or APIs.
- **Improvements**:
  - Replace Google scraping with a robust search API (e.g., SerpAPI, Google Custom Search API) for reliability.
  - Implement URL ranking based on relevance, domain authority, or content type.
  - Allow users to specify preferred search engines or domains.
  - Add error handling for rate limits and retries.

#### 2.3 Content Scraping
- **Current State**: Uses `crawl4ai` with concurrent scraping via `ThreadPoolExecutor`.
- **Limitations**:
  - `crawl4ai` may fail on dynamic or JavaScript-heavy sites.
  - No fallback mechanism if `crawl4ai` fails.
  - No content filtering (e.g., removing ads, irrelevant sections).
  - Limited error handling for scraping failures.
- **Improvements**:
  - Add fallback scraping methods (e.g., `playwright` for dynamic sites).
  - Implement content filtering to extract only relevant sections (e.g., main article content).
  - Enhance error handling with retries and logging.
  - Add content validation (e.g., minimum length, relevance check).

#### 2.4 Summarization and Follow-Up Questions
- **Current State**: Uses LLMs to summarize content and generate follow-up questions.
- **Limitations**:
  - Summaries may be generic or miss key insights due to content length limits (10,000 characters).
  - Follow-up questions are not validated for relevance or feasibility.
  - No mechanism to prioritize or refine follow-up questions.
  - Limited error handling for LLM failures.
- **Improvements**:
  - Enhance summarization prompts to focus on key insights and avoid redundancy.
  - Implement chunking for long content to handle length limits.
  - Validate follow-up questions for relevance and diversity.
  - Add error handling with retries and fallback LLMs.
  - Allow users to customize summarization style (e.g., detailed, concise).

#### 2.5 Report Generation
- **Current State**: Generates a Markdown report with sections for queries, summaries, and follow-up questions.
- **Limitations**:
  - Report structure is basic and lacks advanced formatting (e.g., tables, citations).
  - No support for exporting to other formats (e.g., PDF, HTML).
  - Limited error reporting in the final output.
  - No mechanism to highlight key findings or insights.
- **Improvements**:
  - Enhance report structure with sections for key findings, citations, and metadata.
  - Add support for exporting to PDF or HTML using libraries like `markdown2` and `pdfkit`.
  - Include error logs and warnings in the report.
  - Highlight key insights using formatting (e.g., bold, bullet points).

#### 2.6 User Interface (Gradio)
- **Current State**: Uses Gradio for input and output, with basic controls.
- **Limitations**:
  - Limited user feedback during long-running processes.
  - No progress bar or status updates.
  - No support for saving/loading research sessions.
  - Limited customization options (e.g., report format, search preferences).
- **Improvements**:
  - Add a progress bar and status updates for long-running tasks.
  - Implement session saving/loading using JSON or SQLite.
  - Add advanced options (e.g., search engine choice, report format).
  - Enhance error handling and user feedback.

### Step 3: Researching Best Practices for Deep Research Tools
To design an optimal deep research tool, I need to research best practices and industry standards. Let's explore key aspects:

#### 3.1 Web Search Implementation
- **Options**:
  1. **Google Scraping**: Current method, but fragile and prone to blocking.
  2. **SerpAPI**: Reliable, supports multiple search engines, but requires an API key.
  3. **Google Custom Search API**: Official API, but limited to 100 free searches/day.
  4. **Bing Search API**: Alternative to Google, affordable pricing.
- **Analysis**:
  - Google scraping is not sustainable due to legal and technical risks.
  - SerpAPI is the best choice for reliability and ease of integration, but requires an API key.
  - Google Custom Search API is viable for small-scale use but limited for deep research.
  - Bing Search API is a good alternative but less popular.
- **Decision**: Use SerpAPI for web searches, with fallback to Google Custom Search API if SerpAPI fails.

#### 3.2 Content Scraping
- **Options**:
  1. **`crawl4ai`**: Current method, good for static sites but limited for dynamic content.
  2. **`playwright`**: Supports dynamic sites, headless browser, but slower.
  3. **`scrapy`**: Powerful for large-scale scraping, but complex.
  4. **Hybrid Approach**: Use `crawl4ai` for static sites and `playwright` for dynamic sites.
- **Analysis**:
  - `crawl4ai` is lightweight but limited for modern websites.
  - `playwright` is robust for dynamic content but resource-intensive.
  - `scrapy` is overkill for this use case.
  - Hybrid approach balances speed and reliability.
- **Decision**: Use a hybrid approach with `crawl4ai` as primary and `playwright` as fallback.

#### 3.3 Summarization and Follow-Up
- **Best Practices**:
  - Use chunking for long content to handle LLM token limits.
  - Enhance prompts to focus on key insights and avoid redundancy.
  - Validate follow-up questions for relevance and diversity.
  - Use multiple LLMs for redundancy and fallback.
- **Decision**: Implement chunking, enhanced prompts, and validation for summaries and follow-up questions.

#### 3.4 Report Generation
- **Best Practices**:
  - Include metadata (e.g., date, query, settings).
  - Use structured sections (e.g., key findings, citations).
  - Support multiple formats (e.g., Markdown, PDF, HTML).
  - Highlight key insights using formatting.
- **Decision**: Enhance report structure and add PDF/HTML export.

#### 3.5 User Interface
- **Best Practices**:
  - Provide progress updates and status feedback.
  - Support session saving/loading.
  - Allow customization (e.g., search engine, report format).
  - Enhance error handling and user feedback.
- **Decision**: Add progress bar, session management, and advanced options.

### Step 4: Designing the Improved Tool

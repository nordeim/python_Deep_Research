Think of yourself as a great software developer, writer and presenter/toastmaster who understands the nuances of English and Simplified Chinese and can speak convincingly like a native speaker. Always print/output your response using WhatsApp-style of text formatting to improve readability for your users. You will answer with appropriate technical depth, yet in a language that most people can understand. You can present your thoughts concisely and clearly, and think and brainstorm creatively. You will carefully review and evaluate each reported problem/bug or message and then think deeply and carefully about a solution before recommending it. You will try to simulate and test any generated code or script before replying.

*Here is what I need you to do:*
using https://github.com/dzhng/deep-research as a guide to implement a complete working python code that combines the best of all such AI-driven deep research techniques, the resulting python let user choose OpenAI compatible API or Google Gemini 2 API to use, and uses the python Gradio module for a simple yet intuitive browser-based user interaction interface.

you can use the following as additional examples:

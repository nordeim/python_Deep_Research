*Survey Results of Known OpenAI Deep Search Methods/Techniques*

Over the past few years, the field of AI-driven deep research has evolved rapidly, with numerous techniques emerging to empower researchers to explore topics in depth and breadth. A survey of the current state-of-the-art methods reveals several key techniques that have become foundational:

• **Iterative Research Process:**  
  Modern deep search systems, such as OpenAI’s Deep Research tool, employ iterative cycles where the system refines its queries based on earlier findings. This feedback loop is critical to enhance accuracy and relevance. Iterative techniques ensure that each subsequent search query builds on the context gathered in previous iterations, resulting in progressively more refined answers.

• **Intelligent Query Generation:**  
  Leveraging large language models (LLMs), systems generate tailored search queries dynamically. This method transforms user inputs into targeted queries that fetch precise information from both traditional search engines and web scraping results. Intelligent query generation minimizes irrelevant data and boosts the quality of results.

• **Depth and Breadth Control:**  
  A notable advancement in research tools is the ability to configure the “depth” (thoroughness) and “breadth” (variety) of the search. This allows users to specify how comprehensive or wide-ranging the exploration should be, enabling a balance between exhaustive detail and diverse perspectives.

• **Smart Follow-up Questions:**  
  Some systems automatically generate follow-up questions based on the initial research output. This adaptive questioning deepens the inquiry and uncovers additional dimensions of the research topic, ensuring a more holistic understanding.

• **Comprehensive Report Generation:**  
  After collating research data, these tools compile detailed markdown or structured reports summarizing findings, sources, and insights. The reports provide a coherent narrative that captures the research process and final conclusions.

• **Concurrent Processing:**  
  To improve efficiency, many implementations process multiple search queries and web scraping tasks in parallel. This concurrent processing is especially useful when handling large datasets or when time-sensitive research is required.

• **Web Scraping and SERP Integration:**  
  Combining traditional search engine results with live web scraping methods enhances the currency and relevance of the research data. Web scraping gathers context that may not be indexed, and its integration with SERP queries offers the latest insights available on the web.

• **Feedback Loop for Recursive Exploration:**  
  A core characteristic of advanced research assistants is their ability to incorporate feedback loops. By revisiting previous steps based on new learnings, the tool continuously refines its approach, thereby achieving a “deep” understanding of the subject matter.

*Section-by-Section Explanation of the Python Code*

The provided Python code is built around a modular design that incorporates the techniques described above. The implementation leverages Gradio for a browser-based UI, and it provides integration with two APIs: an OpenAI-compatible API and the Google Gemini 2 API. Below is a detailed breakdown of each section:

──────────────────────────────
1. **API Clients and Configuration**

   The initial part of the code handles the importation of necessary packages and sets up API keys. This ensures that both the OpenAI and Gemini clients can be configured securely using environment variables.

   **Key Components:**
   - **Imports:**  
     The code imports necessary modules such as `os`, `requests`, `BeautifulSoup` for web scraping, and `gradio` for the UI. In addition, the code attempts to import API-specific modules for OpenAI and Google Gemini.
   - **API Key Configuration:**  
     API keys are retrieved from environment variables. Fallback keys are provided, though using secure environment variables is highly recommended.

   **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   import os
   import requests
   from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
   import gradio as gr

   # API clients – ensure these packages are installed
   try:
       import openai
   except ImportError:
       raise ImportError("Please install the openai package: pip install openai")
   try:
       import google.generativeai as genai
   except ImportError:
       raise ImportError("Please install the google-generativeai package: pip install google-generativeai")

   # Configuration – securely load API keys
   OPENAI_API_KEY = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY", "YOUR_OPENAI_FALLBACK_KEY")
   GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY = os.environ.get("GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY", "YOUR_GEMINI_FALLBACK_KEY")
   ```

   **Discussion:**  
   This section sets up the environment and dependencies. The design emphasizes security by recommending the use of environment variables rather than hardcoding sensitive data. The code also gracefully handles missing dependencies by prompting the user to install the necessary packages.

──────────────────────────────
2. **Helper Functions**

   The helper functions form the backbone of the application by providing utility methods for web scraping and querying the APIs.

   **a. Web Scraping Function: `fetch_web_content`**

   **Functionality:**  
   - Connects to a given URL using `requests`.
   - Parses the webpage content with BeautifulSoup.
   - Extracts text using `soup.get_text()`, ensuring the content is clean and separated by newline characters.
   - Implements error handling for network or parsing issues.

   **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   def fetch_web_content(url):
       """
       Fetches and parses web content from a URL using BeautifulSoup.
       """
       try:
           response = requests.get(url)
           response.raise_for_status()  # Detect bad responses
           soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
           return soup.get_text(separator="\n")
       except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
           return f"Error fetching URL: {e}"
       except Exception as e:
           return f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}"
   ```

   **b. Query Functions: `query_openai` and `query_gemini`**

   **Functionality:**  
   - `query_openai`:  
     Sends a chat-based prompt to the OpenAI API. The prompt is built to include both system instructions and the user's research query. The function manages errors related to connectivity and unexpected exceptions.
   - `query_gemini`:  
     Similar in design, it queries the Google Gemini 2 API using the provided prompt and returns the generated content.

   **Code Snippets:**
   ```python
   def query_openai(prompt, model="gpt-4o-mini"):
       """
       Queries the OpenAI API (or a compatible API).
       """
       openai.api_key = OPENAI_API_KEY
       try:
           response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
               model=model,
               messages=[
                   {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful research assistant skilled in providing comprehensive and well-structured answers based on provided web content and user queries."},
                   {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
               ]
           )
           return response.choices[0].message.content.strip()
       except openai.APIConnectionError as e:
           return f"OpenAI Connection Error: {e}"
       except Exception as e:
           return f"An unexpected error occurred with OpenAI: {e}"
   ```

   ```python
   def query_gemini(prompt):
       """
       Queries the Google Gemini 2 API.
       """
       genai.configure(api_key=GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY)
       model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp')
       try:
           response = model.generate_content(prompt)
           return response.text.strip()
       except Exception as e:
           return f"An unexpected error occurred with Google Gemini: {e}"
   ```

   **Discussion:**  
   These functions abstract the complexity of API calls. They ensure that the rest of the application can simply call these functions without worrying about low-level details. Error handling within these functions is robust, thereby enhancing reliability.

──────────────────────────────
3. **Core Research Function: `deep_research`**

   **Functionality:**  
   This function orchestrates the research process. It follows these steps:
   - **Web Scraping:**  
     If the user provides a list of URLs, the function scrapes content from each URL and concatenates it with appropriate section headers.
   - **Prompt Construction:**  
     Depending on whether web content is available, it builds a combined prompt. This prompt includes the user’s research query and any additional context provided by the scraped content.
   - **API Querying:**  
     Based on the user’s choice (OpenAI or Gemini), it forwards the prompt to the corresponding query function.

   **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   def deep_research(query, api_choice, urls_to_scrape):
       """
       Performs deep research on a given query.
       
       🟢 *Parameters:*
         - **query:** The research question.
         - **api_choice:** "openai" or "gemini".
         - **urls_to_scrape:** Comma-separated URLs to scrape for additional context.
         
       🟢 *Process:*
         1. Scrapes provided URLs.
         2. Constructs a prompt combining the user query and scraped content.
         3. Queries the chosen API and returns a detailed response.
       """
       # 1. Web Scraping (if URLs are provided)
       scraped_content = ""
       if urls_to_scrape:
           url_list = [url.strip() for url in urls_to_scrape.split(",") if url.strip()]
           for url in url_list:
               content = fetch_web_content(url)
               scraped_content += f"\n\n--- Content from {url} ---\n\n{content}"

       # 2. Construct the prompt
       if scraped_content:
           combined_prompt = (
               f"Here is the user's research query: {query}\n\n"
               f"Below is some web content to assist your research. Use this as background context, "
               f"but do not repeat it verbatim in your answer:\n\n{scraped_content}\n\n"
               "Please provide a comprehensive, detailed, and well-structured answer."
           )
       else:
           combined_prompt = (
               f"Here is the user's research query: {query}\n\n"
               "Please provide a comprehensive, detailed, and well-structured answer."
           )

       # 3. Query the chosen API
       if api_choice.lower() == "openai":
           research_result = query_openai(combined_prompt)
       elif api_choice.lower() == "gemini":
           research_result = query_gemini(combined_prompt)
       else:
           research_result = "Invalid API choice. Please select either 'openai' or 'gemini'."

       return research_result
   ```

   **Discussion:**  
   The `deep_research` function is the centerpiece of the application. It encapsulates the entire research workflow, from gathering external data to constructing a prompt for the language model. The design ensures that users receive an answer that reflects both their query and the most relevant, up-to-date web content.

──────────────────────────────
4. **Gradio Interface Construction**

   **Functionality:**  
   The final part of the code sets up a user-friendly browser interface using Gradio. The interface:
   - Displays a title and markdown description.
   - Provides input fields for the research query, API selection (radio button), and URLs to scrape.
   - Includes an output textbox where the research results are displayed.
   - Utilizes a button to trigger the research process by calling the `deep_research` function.

   **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   if __name__ == '__main__':
       with gr.Blocks() as interface:
           gr.Markdown("### 🟢 AI-Powered Deep Research Tool")
           with gr.Row():
               with gr.Column():
                   query_input = gr.Textbox(
                       label="Research Query",
                       placeholder="Enter your research query here...",
                       lines=3
                   )
                   api_choice = gr.Radio(
                       label="Choose API",
                       choices=["openai", "gemini"],
                       value="openai"
                   )
                   urls_input = gr.Textbox(
                       label="URLs to Scrape (comma-separated)",
                       placeholder="e.g., https://example.com",
                       lines=2
                   )
                   submit_button = gr.Button("Perform Research")
               with gr.Column():
                   output_text = gr.Textbox(
                       label="Research Results",
                       placeholder="Your research results will appear here...",
                       lines=15
                   )
           
           submit_button.click(
               fn=deep_research,
               inputs=[query_input, api_choice, urls_input],
               outputs=output_text
           )
       
       # Launch the Gradio interface on all network interfaces for broader accessibility.
       interface.launch(share=False, debug=True, server_name="0.0.0.0")
   ```

   **Discussion:**  
   This section illustrates how the code provides a clean and intuitive user interface. By leveraging Gradio’s layout features (Rows, Columns, Markdown, Textboxes, and Buttons), the application is made accessible even to non-technical users. The interface design also supports quick modifications, such as adjusting placeholder text or layout options.

──────────────────────────────
5. **Comparison with Provided References and Enhancements**

   In comparing the generated code with the reference repositories (namely the GitHub repository for [dzhng/deep-research](https://github.com/dzhng/deep-research) and the [python_Deep_Research example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nordeim/python_Deep_Research/refs/heads/main/Deep_Research_web.py)), several similarities and enhancements become evident:

   **Similarities:**

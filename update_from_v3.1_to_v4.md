*üîé Code Review of `deep_research_web_v4.py`*

Let's break down the existing code section by section:

*   **Configuration and Imports:**  Standard setup, loading environment variables for API keys, and importing necessary libraries (`requests`, `bs4`, `gradio`, `openai`, `google.generativeai`, `dotenv`, `concurrent.futures`, `urllib.parse`). Looks good.
*   **`fetch_web_content(url)`:**
    *   Fetches web content using `requests` and parses it with `BeautifulSoup`.
    *   Includes error handling for `requests.exceptions.RequestException` and general exceptions.
    *   Removes `<script>` and `<style>` tags, which is good for cleaning up content for LLMs.
    *   Returns plain text content.
    *   **Potential Issue**:  Relies on `requests`, which might not handle JavaScript-heavy websites perfectly.  `crawl4ai` with Playwright can improve this.
*   **`query_openai(prompt, model="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0.7)` and `query_gemini(prompt)`:**
    *   Functions to interact with OpenAI and Gemini models.
    *   Includes basic error handling for API client initialization and API calls.
    *   Uses `gpt-4o-mini` as the default OpenAI model. User might want to configure this.
*   **`generate_search_queries(base_query, num_queries, llm_choice, follow_up_questions="")`:**
    *   Generates search queries using either OpenAI or Gemini based on `llm_choice`.
    *   Cleans up the LLM response to extract queries as a numbered list.
    *   **Good approach**: Uses LLMs to diversify search queries.
*   **`perform_google_search(query)`:**
    *   Performs a Google search using `requests` and parses the results with `BeautifulSoup`.
    *   Extracts top 5 URLs from Google search results.
    *   **Potential Issue**:  Relies on parsing Google search result HTML, which can be brittle and might break if Google changes its HTML structure.  This is a common challenge with scraping Google search results directly.
    *   **Red Flag**: Extracts `netloc` (domain name) from the URLs, not the full URLs. This might limit the scraping to just the domain's homepage instead of specific pages found in search results.
*   **`scrape_urls_concurrently(urls)`:**
    *   Scrapes multiple URLs concurrently using `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`.
    *   Uses `fetch_web_content` to get content for each URL.
    *   Handles exceptions during scraping and reports them in the results.
    *   **Good implementation**:  Concurrency improves scraping speed.
*   **`research_iteration(base_query, llm_choice, num_search_queries, follow_up_questions="")`:**
    *   Orchestrates one iteration of the research process:
        *   Generates search queries.
        *   Performs Google searches and gets URLs.
        *   Scrapes content from URLs concurrently.
        *   Generates a summary and follow-up questions using the chosen LLM.
    *   Combines scraped content into a single string for summarization.
    *   **Good modular design**:  Breaks down the research process into steps.
*   **`deep_research(query, llm_choice, depth, num_search_queries, urls_to_scrape="")`:**
    *   Performs deep research by iterating `research_iteration` for a specified depth.
    *   Handles manually provided URLs as an initial step.
    *   Constructs a Markdown report of the research process.
    *   **Well-structured function**: Manages the overall research flow and report generation.
*   **Gradio Interface (`if __name__ == '__main__':`)**
    *   Sets up a Gradio interface with input fields for query, LLM choice, depth, number of queries, and manual URLs.
    *   Output textbox for displaying research results.
    *   Uses `submit_button.click` to connect the `deep_research` function to the UI.
    *   Launches the Gradio interface.
    *   **Standard Gradio setup**: Easy to use interface.

*üìù Identified Issues and Inconsistencies:*

1.  **Google Search Scraping:**  Parsing Google search result HTML (`perform_google_search`) is unreliable.  It's better to use a dedicated search API or consider using `crawl4ai` for more robust URL extraction if possible (though `crawl4ai` is primarily for website content crawling, not search result parsing).  Also, extracting only `netloc` is limiting. We should aim to get full URLs from search results.
2.  **JavaScript Handling:**  `fetch_web_content` uses `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`, which might not fully render JavaScript.  For modern, dynamic websites, this can lead to incomplete or missing content. `crawl4ai` with Playwright will address this.
3.  **Error Handling:** Error handling is present but could be more detailed.  For instance, logging specific error types and messages could be helpful for debugging.
4.  **Model Configuration:** The OpenAI model is hardcoded as `gpt-4o-mini`. It would be better to make this configurable via UI or environment variable.
5.  **No Rate Limiting/Politeness:** The code doesn't seem to have explicit rate limiting or politeness measures when scraping websites.  This could potentially lead to issues with websites blocking the scraper. `crawl4ai` might offer some built-in politeness features, but we should double-check.

*üí° Integration of `crawl4ai`*

`crawl4ai` is an excellent choice to address the JavaScript handling and potentially improve the robustness of web crawling. Here's how we can integrate it:

1.  **Replace `fetch_web_content`:**  We can replace the `fetch_web_content` function with `crawl4ai`'s web crawling capabilities. `crawl4ai` uses Playwright under the hood, so it will handle JavaScript rendering seamlessly. We can directly get Markdown, JSON, or text output from `crawl4ai`, making it easier to process the content.
2.  **Rethink `perform_google_search`:**  Instead of scraping Google search results directly, which is fragile, we could:
    *   **Option 1 (Simpler but less direct):** Keep the `perform_google_search` function as is for now, but be aware of its limitations. We can use `crawl4ai` to scrape the *URLs obtained from Google Search*.  However, we should extract the full URLs, not just `netloc`.
    *   **Option 2 (More Robust, if feasible):** Explore if `crawl4ai` or Playwright can be used to interact with Google Search in a more structured way (e.g., using selectors to get result links). This might still be fragile if Google's HTML changes.
    *   **Option 3 (Best but might be more complex):** Consider using a Search API (like Google Custom Search API or SerpAPI) for getting search results in a structured JSON format. This is the most reliable way but might require API keys and have usage limits. For this iteration, let's stick to Option 1 for simplicity, but improve URL extraction to get full URLs.

*‚úÖ Plan for Updated Code:*

1.  **Modify `perform_google_search`:**
    *   Update the URL extraction logic in `perform_google_search` to get full URLs from Google search results instead of just `netloc`.
2.  **Replace `fetch_web_content` with `crawl4ai`:**
    *   Remove `fetch_web_content` function.
    *   In `scrape_urls_concurrently`, use `crawl4ai.AsyncWebCrawler` to fetch content from URLs.  We can get Markdown output from `crawl4ai`.
3.  **Update `scrape_urls_concurrently`:**
    *   Modify `scrape_urls_concurrently` to use `crawl4ai` for scraping.
4.  **Keep other functions:**  `generate_search_queries`, `query_openai`, `query_gemini`, `research_iteration`, `deep_research`, and the Gradio interface structure can largely remain the same, but we'll need to adjust them to work with the output format of `crawl4ai`.
5.  **Error Handling & Logging:**  Enhance error messages where appropriate.
6.  **Configuration:**  Consider making the OpenAI model configurable if time permits. For now, we'll focus on core functionality and `crawl4ai` integration.

Let's start by updating `perform_google_search` to extract full URLs and then move to integrating `crawl4ai` for content fetching.

Here's the first step - updating `perform_google_search`.

```python
def perform_google_search(query):
    """Performs a Google search and returns the top URLs."""
    try:
        search_url = f"https://www.google.com/search?q={urllib.parse.quote_plus(query)}"
        headers = {
            'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36'
        }
        response = requests.get(search_url, headers=headers, timeout=10)
        response.raise_for_status()
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

        # Extract URLs - Updated to use a more robust selector and get full URLs
        search_results = soup.select('a[href^="/url?q="]')
        urls = [urllib.parse.unquote(result['href'].replace('/url?q=', '').split('&')[0]) for result in search_results] # Get full URLs

        # Remove duplicates and empty strings, then return only the top 5 unique URLs
        unique_urls = []
        for url in urls:
            if url and url not in unique_urls:
                unique_urls.append(url)
            if len(unique_urls) == 5:
                break
        return unique_urls

    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Error during Google search: {e}")
        return []
```

I've changed this line:

```python
urls = [urllib.parse.urlparse(urllib.parse.unquote(result['href'].replace('/url?q=', '').split('&')[0])).netloc for result in search_results]
```

to

```python
urls = [urllib.parse.unquote(result['href'].replace('/url?q=', '').split('&')[0]) for result in search_results]
```

Now, instead of extracting just `netloc`, it extracts the full URL from the `href` attribute. Let's test this updated function first. I'll use a `tool_code` block to test `perform_google_search`.

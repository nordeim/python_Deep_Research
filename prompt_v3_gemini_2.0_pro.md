carefully review the attached sample python codes against the requirements below and then think deeply and thoroughly to evaluate various implementation options before choosing the most optimal one to produce as a final output a complete fully tested working python app that combines the best ideas from the sample codes with enhancements based on your research with extensive web searches.

### Requirements Specification ###
OpenAI's Deep Research tool employs a variety of advanced techniques aimed at facilitating iterative and comprehensive research on a wide array of topics. Below is a detailed overview of the key techniques utilized by this tool:

# 1. Iterative Research Process
The Deep Research tool is designed to refine its research approach dynamically based on previous findings. This iterative method allows the tool to adjust its research focus continually, enabling a more in-depth exploration as it gathers insights. Each iteration builds upon the last, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the topic at hand.

# 2. Intelligent Query Generation
Leveraging large language models (LLMs), the tool creates targeted search queries that align with the user's research goals. This intelligent query generation increases the relevance of search results, as the tool can formulate queries that reflect the nuances of the research topic and adapt based on the insights gained during the research process.

# 3. Depth and Breadth Control
Users can specify parameters for both the depth and breadth of the research. The *depth* refers to how thorough the investigation will be, while *breadth* defines the range of topics covered. This flexibility allows users to tailor their research experience according to their specific needs, whether they require a broad overview or a deep dive into specific aspects of a topic.

# 4. Smart Follow-up Questions
As it processes information, the tool generates follow-up questions to clarify and further explore relevant inquiries. This feature not only helps guide the research in a more focused direction but also encourages deeper investigation into key areas of interest, enhancing the overall depth of the inquiry.

# 5. Comprehensive Report Generation
After completing the research process, the Deep Research tool compiles its findings into detailed markdown reports. These reports summarize the key learnings and include references and sources, providing an organized and clear outline of the research journey and its outcomes. This documentation is essential for users looking to reference their findings or share results with others.

# 6. Concurrent Processing
The tool is capable of executing multiple searches and processing results simultaneously, which significantly enhances efficiency. By running several research queries in parallel, the tool can gather and analyze data from a variety of sources at once, reducing the overall time spent on research and allowing for broader data coverage.

# 7. Web Scraping and Search Engine Integration
Combining web scraping capabilities with Search Engine Results Page (SERP) queries, the Deep Research tool is equipped to gather information from both indexed data and live web content. This dual approach ensures that users receive the most current and relevant insights, as the tool can extract information beyond conventional search engine results.

# 8. Feedback Loop for Recursive Exploration
The research tool incorporates a feedback loop that allows it to revisit previous steps based on learnings from its findings. This recursive exploration enables the tool to generate new research directions and enhance the depth of inquiry continually. It creates a continuous learning environment where each set of findings informs future research steps.

# Conclusion
In summary, OpenAI's Deep Research tool utilizes a sophisticated blend of techniques that integrate AI capabilities with traditional research methodologies. Features such as iterative processes, intelligent query generation, customizable depth and breadth, smart follow-up questions, comprehensive reporting, concurrent processing, web scraping, and recursive exploration work synergistically to provide users with a robust and adaptable research experience. These capabilities cater to users seeking detailed insights while maintaining an efficient and streamlined approach to information gathering and analysis.
